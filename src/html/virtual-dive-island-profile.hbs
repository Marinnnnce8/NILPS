            <p>Westray, “Queen o’ the Isles”, is the most north westerly island of the Orkney archipelago, with a
                vibrant community and maritime industry. The island is around 16 kilometres long and up to 6 km wide
                with a diverse coast comprising extensive cliffs, low lying rock shelves and sandy bays. The west coast
                of the island, extending to Noup Head, bears the full brunt of the forces from the North Atlantic seas,
                with waves reaching over 20 metres in height as they approach the exposed headlands and cliffs. Over the
                millennia this powerful and relentless wave action, along with beating rain and cascading burns, has
                sculpted the rock into intricate ledges and precipitous overhangs, deep gullies, isolated stacks, caves
                and the towering cliffs with their sheer drops.</p>
            <p>The Noup Head cliffs (noup being Old Norse for “steep headland”), on the most westerly tip of Westray,
                rise up to 90 metres tall and are home to one of the largest seabird colonies

            <p>On shelving rocks near the base of the cliffs grey seals haul out, and further out in the rapidly
                deepening waters, dolphins and killer or minke whales might pass by.</p>
            <p>Underneath the frenzied nesting activity on the cliffs the wave-agitated intertidal zone, filled with
                shore life and foam, soon gives way to a more sedate and tranquil rock-scape world. Here the various
                seaweeds and sea creatures compete for space to cling to rocks, find shelter or to harvest the
                productive waters. Each species has its own particular needs and abilities which means that everything
                has its best-suited place. This ‘niche’ adaptation leads to a pattern of species zonation according to
                water depth, associated light level and degree of wave exposure, creating bands of distinct species
                assemblages in the range of conditions. For example, in shallower regions where light intensity and wave
                action is greatest, kelp canopies dominate. The abundance of kelp decreases with depth, being replaced
                by smaller red seaweeds and a diverse animal ‘turf’ which colonises the rock surfaces. This encrusting
                mat can include sea anemones, sponges, sea mats, sea squirts, brittle stars, sea slugs and snails,
                mussels, barnacles, calcified worms and a host of other marine creatures. The rich diversity and beauty
                of these animal and seaweed communities can be breath-taking, creating walls of vivid colours
                reminiscent of a coral reef in deeper waters, and producing a surging and flowing layer of seaweed,
                water and foam at the surface.</p>
            <p>The natural heritage importance of the cliffs and environs of Noup Head is recognised at local, national
                and international levels.

                Environmental designations seek to protect and enhance the
                wildlife
                populations and associated habitats that are present.
            </p>
            <p>The designated interests are monitored at intervals to check on species numbers and habitat quality. Over
                recent years it has become clear that certain seabird populations such as kittiwakes and arctic skuas
                have been declining, whilst at the same time other species such as gannets have been increasing. It is
                widely believed that these changes are linked to climate change which has altered the distribution,
                abundance and therefore availability of the key prey for certain species. The geographical range over
                which such changes may be important for the seabirds are immense. Arctic terns migrate to and from the
                Southern Ocean, great skuas winters off western Africa whilst fulmars may forage off Nova Scotia. Even
                the range of the daily foraging trips of these and the other species during the chick-rearing season are
                extensive, covering up to hundreds of miles.</p>
            <p>The vibrant biodiversity of the Noup Head cliffs and the wider marine ecosystem are linked and
                interdependent. The grand cliffs of Noup Head allow you to see so much of this ecosystem function play
                out in front of your eyes.
